# API

Every exported name of `PoroMechanics`.

```@docs
PoroMechanics
```

## Model and solver types

```@docs
AbstractPoroModel
AbstractPoroSolver
```

## Finite volume interface

Callbacks consumed by [VoronoiFVM.jl](https://github.com/j-fu/VoronoiFVM.jl). A model
implements the ones its physics needs; the Jacobian is obtained from them by automatic
differentiation, never written by hand.

## Finite element interface

Callbacks consumed by [Ferrite.jl](https://github.com/Ferrite-FEM/Ferrite.jl).

```@docs
assemble_element!
element_matrices!
facet_load!
```

## Model introspection

```@docs

```

## Constitutive layer

Material laws owned by the package. Every law carries its coefficients as *type
parameters*, so a result can be differentiated with respect to the parameters themselves
and not only with respect to the unknowns — the property that makes inverse calibration
and sensitivity analysis possible.

## Backends

Glue to the solver packages. The physics lives in the constitutive layer; these only wire
it up.
